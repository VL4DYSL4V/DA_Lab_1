## Activity Period

An activity period is the period of time during which your revenue activity occurred,
such as when purchases or rentals took place. Many stores don't provide distributors
the specific day each transaction occurs, so they will report the number of transactions
during an activity period. An activity period is typically a calendar month, but may
be as long as 3 consecutive calendar months.
